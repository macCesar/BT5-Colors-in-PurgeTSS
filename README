# BT5 Colors in PurgeTSS

## Overview

This Sample App demonstrates the ease of creating a custom color palette for your Titanium mobile application using [PurgeTSS](https://purgetss.com).

We've created a custom color palette inspired by Bootstrap 5 Alpha 2 theme colors and showcased it within the app. This project aims to highlight how simple it is to work with and recreate a personalized color palette using PurgeTSS.
