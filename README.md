# BT5 Colors in PurgeTSS

## Overview

### Color System

This Sample App demonstrates the ease of creating a custom color palette for your [Titanium](https://titaniumsdk.com) mobile application using [PurgeTSS](https://purgetss.com).

We've created a custom color palette inspired by Bootstrap 5 colors and showcased it within the app. This project aims to highlight how simple it is to work with and recreate a personalized color palette using PurgeTSS.

## Bootstrap Icons

A free, high-quality, open-source icon library with over 2,000 icons. The original Bootstrap Icons are available in SVGs, SVG sprites, and web fonts.

**We've converted the original `.woff` font file to `.ttf` for use in any Titanium mobile app.**

Here's the [Font File](app/assets/fonts/bootstrap-icons.ttf), the [Styles file](purgetss/styles/fonts.tss), and the [Commond-JS](app/lib/purgetss.fonts.js) file.

In the `Icons` tab, click on any of the icons to view an example code and see the class name.
